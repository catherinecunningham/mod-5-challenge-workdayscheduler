# Module 5 Challenge - Work Day Scheduler

Using provided starter code, I have developed an app that allows users to input events at specific times throughout the work day.  When users press the Save button, the event is saved to local storage.  Timeblocks for events that are in the past are colorcoded gray, timeblocks that are currently taking place are colorcoded red, and timeblocks that are upcoming are colorcoded green.  The app has the current time and date displayed at the top of the page.  The scheduler should update the upcoming events every hour and no longer display past events.

This app was made by myself with help from a tutor and teaching assistant.  I am seeking feedback on working with local storage through JavaScript and jQuery, as I feel that is a place I need to improve.

The app can be found at this website:
